  <h2>为什么英语那么烂？</h2>
  <p>从初中（90后从小学）就开始学习英语，到大学本科毕业至少学了10+年英语，但还是看专业（例如，<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/" target="_blank">glibc</a>）手册很吃力，给开源软件作者写邮件不知所云，听GNOME Summit、<a href="https://akademy.kde.org" target="_blank">KDE Akademy</a>演讲者发言像听天书，和国外程序员交流开不了口！是智商问题吗？！很多偏科的（英语考试一般不及格）理科生要不服气了：<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/23542273" target="_blank">记忆力怎么能算智商</a>？！不服气吗？</p>
  <h3>来做道阅读理解题</h3>
  <p>Many of the remaining functions refer to the input and output queues of a terminal device. These queues implement a form of buffering within the kernel independent of the buffering implemented by I/O streams.

The terminal input queue is also sometimes referred to as its typeahead buffer. It holds the characters that have been received from the terminal but not yet read by any process.

The size of the input queue is described by the MAX_INPUT and _POSIX_MAX_INPUT parameters. You are guaranteed a queue size of at least MAX_INPUT, but the queue might be larger, and might even dynamically change size. If input flow control is enabled by setting the IXOFF input mode bit, the terminal driver transmits STOP and START characters to the terminal when necessary to prevent the queue from overflowing. Otherwise, input may be lost if it comes in too fast from the terminal. In canonical mode, all input stays in the queue until a newline character is received, so the terminal input queue can fill up when you type a very long line.

The terminal output queue is like the input queue, but for output; it contains characters that have been written by processes, but not yet transmitted to the terminal. If output flow control is enabled by setting the IXON input mode bit, the terminal driver obeys START and STOP characters sent by the terminal to stop and restart transmission of output.

Clearing the terminal input queue means discarding any characters that have been received but not yet read. Similarly, clearing the terminal output queue means discarding any characters that have been written but not yet transmitted.</p>
  <p>问题：The size of the input queue is</p>
  <p>A: MAX_INPUT</p>
  <p>B: larger than 1024</p>
  <p>C: dynamically change size</p>
  <p>D: _POSIX_MAX_INPUT</p>

  <h3>来写封电子邮件</h3>
  <p><a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2015-August/042974.html" target="_blank">反驳"I remember pointing you at user-accounts"</a></p>
  <p>I am very confused. Can I check I have everything straight.

We had kcm_useraccounts in plasma-desktop, which is super old and rubbish

We had user-manager, somwhere, which is Alex's one.It uses
accounts-service, via it's own lib

In plasma-desktop we have a branch caller user-accounts by Leslie and
FJiang with a lot of recent commits
This contains a modification of kcm_useraccounts, but using hawaii's
QtAccountsService :/


Leslie, I remember pointing you at user-accounts.

You even replied,
"I just wanna join the user-manager project, thanks a lot!"

How come you then ended up changing to doing something else?</p>

  <h3>电子邮件可以参考乔布斯的：</h3>
  <p>To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community:<br />

I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.<br />

I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.<br />

As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple.<br />

I believe Apple’s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role.<br />

I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.<br />
